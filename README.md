# Fall Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a fall detection system using Python. The system utilizes various sensors and algorithms to detect falls in real-time, providing alerts and data for further analysis.

## Features
- Real-time fall detection
- Sensor integration
- Data logging and analysis
- User-friendly interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fall-Detection.git
   cd Fall-Detection
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the fall detection system, execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
